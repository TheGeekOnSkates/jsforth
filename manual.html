		<h1 id="intro">Overview</h1>
		<p>
			This is a Forth implementation in Javascript, with a REPL using <a href="https://xtermjs.org/" target="_blank">xterm.js</a>.
			It started out as a student's college assignment, but it has the potential to be something much cooler and more useful.
			For more info on Forth, see <a href=https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Starting FORTH</a>.  It's a simple stack-based
			language, low-level in some ways and yet high-level in others.  The best (or at least funniest) description I ever read is
			in <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/" target="_blank">this article</a>: "Forth is what
			youâ€™d get if Python slept with Assembly Language: interactive, expressive, and without syntactical baggage, but still very
			close to the metal. Is it a high-level language or a low-level language? Yes! Or rather, itâ€™s the shortest path from one to
			the other."  Who wouldn't want that in a brwoser? ðŸ¤£

		<h1 id="words">Supported standard Forth words</h1>
		<h2 id="leftParen">(</h2>
		<p>Starts a comment.  For example:</p>
		<code>: doop ( more phonetically correct) dup ;</code>
		<p>In this goofy and kind of pointless example, created a new word "doop" that just runs "dup".  But I explained why in a comment.  Note that, like in nearly all Forths, there has to be a space after the "(" character for this to work.  Doing this has no effect on the stack, so it's a nice way to add comments in your code.</p>
		<p>In fact, the Forth community has kind of adopted this type of comment as a way to tell us what a word does to the stack.  If I wanted to do that with my dopey doop example, my code might look something like this:</p>
		<code>: doop ( number -- number numberAgain ) dup ;</code>
		<p>There's also a form of shorthand that's probably in the standard by now, like using "n" instead of "number", but that is beyond the scope of this manual.</p>
		<h2 id="comment">\</h2>
		<p>This is another way to write a comment.  The difference here is that you don't have to "close it".  This is like "//" or "#" in other languages.  For example:</p>
		<code>: one year 60 24 * 365 * ;    \ 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days</code>
		<h2 id="plus">+</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>3 4 +</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 7</p>
		<h2 id="minus">-</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, subtracts the second from the first, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>10 2 -</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 8</p>
		<h2 id="times">*</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>5 8 *</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 40</p>
		<h2 id="slash">/</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, divides the second by the first, and pushes the result onto the stack.  A few important notes here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is whole-number ("integer") division; there are no decimal places in the result.</li>
			<li>Trying to divide by zero will show an error.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<code>10 2 /</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 5</p>
		<h2 id="mod">mod</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, divides the second by the first, and pushes the remainder (die-hard Roman math lovers call this "Modulus" and/or "Modulo" - sorry, I don't have any Roman buddies to confirm the exact usage, so I'm calling it "remainder") onto the stack.  Note that just like with <code>/</code>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is whole-number ("integer") division; there are no decimal places in the result.</li>
			<li>Trying to divide by zero will show an error.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<code>10 3 mod</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 1</p>




		<h1 id="JSForthWords">JSForth-specific words</h1>
		<h2 id="pow">^</h2>
		<p>This calculates exponents.  For example:</p>
		<code>
		2 2 * 2 * .    \ 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.  OR you could do...
		2 3 ^ .        \ 2 to the third power = 8
		</code>
