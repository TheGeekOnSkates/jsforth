		<h1 id="intro">Overview</h1>
		<p>
			This is a Forth implementation in Javascript, with a REPL using <a href="https://xtermjs.org/" target="_blank">xterm.js</a>.
			It started out as a student's college assignment, but it has the potential to be something much cooler and more useful.
			For more info on Forth, see <a href=https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Starting FORTH</a>.  It's a simple stack-based
			language, low-level in some ways and yet high-level in others.  The best (or at least funniest) description I ever read is
			in <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/" target="_blank">this article</a>: "Forth is what
			youâ€™d get if Python slept with Assembly Language: interactive, expressive, and without syntactical baggage, but still very
			close to the metal. Is it a high-level language or a low-level language? Yes! Or rather, itâ€™s the shortest path from one to
			the other."  Who wouldn't want that in a brwoser? ðŸ¤£

		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>3 4 +</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 7</p>
