		<h1 id="intro">Overview</h1>
		<p>
			This is a Forth implementation in Javascript, with a REPL using <a href="https://xtermjs.org/" target="_blank">xterm.js</a>.
			It started out as a student's college assignment, but it has the potential to be something much cooler and more useful.
			For more info on Forth, see <a href=https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Starting FORTH</a>.  It's a simple stack-based
			language, low-level in some ways and yet high-level in others.  The best (or at least funniest) description I ever read is
			in <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/" target="_blank">this article</a>: "Forth is what
			youâ€™d get if Python slept with Assembly Language: interactive, expressive, and without syntactical baggage, but still very
			close to the metal. Is it a high-level language or a low-level language? Yes! Or rather, itâ€™s the shortest path from one to
			the other."  Who wouldn't want that in a brwoser? ðŸ¤£

		<h2 id="plus">+</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>3 4 +</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 7</p>
		<h2 id="minus">-</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, subtracts the second from the first, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>10 2 -</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 8</p>
		<h2 id="times">*</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result onto the stack.  For example:</p>
		<code>5 8 *</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 40</p>
		<h2 id="slash">/</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, divides the second by the first, and pushes the result onto the stack.  A few important notes here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is whole-number ("integer") division; there are no decimal places in the result.</li>
			<li>Trying to divide by zero will show an error.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<code>10 2 /</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 5</p>
		<h2 id="mod">mod</h2>
		<p>Pops the top two numbers off the stack, divides the second by the first, and pushes the remainder (die-hard Roman math lovers call this "Modulus" and/or "Modulo" - sorry, I don't have any Roman buddies to confirm the exact usage, so I'm calling it "remainder") onto the stack.  Note that just like with <code>/</code>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is whole-number ("integer") division; there are no decimal places in the result.</li>
			<li>Trying to divide by zero will show an error.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<code>10 3 mod</code>
		<p>Displays: Nothing; Stack: 1</p>
