# TO-DO's

In no particular order...

* Finish tweaking my input event handler; Backspace isn't quite right, no arrow key support, etc.  Buggy.
* Once I do that, may as well add `KEY`
* Add variables and constants
* Keep adding more standard Forth words
* Test all words, and finish the manual
* Push to master, submit a PR and see if he goes for it.  Either way, keep on going FORTH! :)
