# TO-DO's

In no particular order...

* Check his existing words to see if they work like they would in other Forths.  I'll be using Gforth to test, but the results should be the same in Pforth etc.
* Add more Forth words in Forth (like I did for `2DUP`)
* Add variables and constants
* Add `s"` and `."`
* As I finish words, add them to the manual
* Push to master, submit a PR and see if he goes for it.  Either way, keep on going FORTH! :)
